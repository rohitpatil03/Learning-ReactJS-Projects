<h2>Birthday Reminder</h2>
<p>This is the basic project made for begineer</p>
<p><b>In this project an array of data is given in the data.js file <br>
we just have to use the data from data.js file and show the output on the screen <br>
Also add a clear button at the end of the list<br><br> </b></p>

<p>To add the data on the webpage we genrally use map function and de-structure the list and show the important elements on the webpage by returning it <br></p>

<p>Now we can add clear button <br></p>

<p>So to add the functionallity to the clear button we can use useState hook to empty the people variable by just using setPeople([]). beacause of this now the people variable is a empty string. thus nothing is shown on the webpage.</p>

<h2>Tabs</h2>
<p><b>As the project name is clear, I tried to make Tabs using ReactJS</b></p>
<p>The most hard part in this project for me was, how we can dynamically change the className.It is generally done by <b>` Write the condition inside me `</b> and then we can write condition in it.<br>
Other things were quite familar for me as other things are previous covered in the above projects</p>

<h2>Slider</h2>
<p><b>I tired to make a slider component using ReactJS</b></p>
<p>This project uses high level of CSS as we try to hide other sildes using css and show them with the help of changing the className in ReactJS</p>
<p>ReactJS is used to dynamically change the className for different slides</p>
