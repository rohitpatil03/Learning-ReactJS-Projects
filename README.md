<h2>Birthday Reminder</h2>
<p>This is the basic project made for begineer</p>
<p><b>In this project an array of data is given in the data.js file <br>
we just have to use the data from data.js file and show the output on the screen <br>
Also add a clear button at the end of the list<br><br> </b></p>

<p>To add the data on the webpage we genrally use map function and de-structure the list and show the important elements on the webpage by returning it <br></p>

<p>Now we can add clear button <br></p>

<p>So to add the functionallity to the clear button we can use useState hook to empty the people variable by just using setPeople([]). beacause of this now the people variable is a empty string. thus nothing is shown on the webpage.</p>
